PS3BluMote Release Notes

PS3BluMote has been partially coded by miljbee with the great help of the InTheHand.Net libraries.
Please read the InTheHand.Net.Licence.txt file.

The original PS3BluMote App was initially coded by BenBarron http://benbarron.com/applications
I have added the hibernation Code.
The method used is the same as the one used by PS3RemoteSleep from riaanc http://ps3remotesleep.codeplex.com/

Concerning my code, do what you want with it, but please, be kind enough to mention me, or to send me your work or improvements.
The source code is available on GitHub : https://github.com/miljbee/PS3BluMote

The usual warnings applies, do what you want with that, but don't expect any support from me, even if it blows your hardware.
If you feel generous, my paypal account is miljbee@gmail.com
